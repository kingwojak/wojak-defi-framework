**Features:**
- Connection Healthcheck
  - Connection healthcheck implementation for peers was introduced. [#2194](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2194)
- Custom Tokens Activation
  - Support for enabling custom EVM (ERC20, PLG20, etc..) tokens without requiring them to be in the coins config was added. [#2141](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2141)
    - This allows users to interact with any ERC20 token by providing the contract address.

**Enhancements/Fixes:**
- Trading Protocol Upgrade [#1895](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/1895)
  - EVM TPU taker methods were implemented and enhancements were made to ETH docker tests. [#2169](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2169)
  - EVM TPU maker methods were implemented. [#2211](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2211)
- NFT integration [#900](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/900)
  - Refund methods for NFT swaps were completed. [#2129](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2129)

- Cosmos Integration [#1432](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/1432)
  - Cosmos tx broadcasting error was fixed by upgrading cosmrs to version 15. [#2238](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2238)
  - Cosmos transaction history implementation was incorrectly parsing addresses (using the relayer address instead of the cross-chain address) from IBC transactions. The address parsing logic was fixed in [#2245](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2245)
- Order Management
  - Cancel order race condition was addressed using time-based cache. [#2232](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2232)
- Swap Improvements
  - A legacy swap issue was resolved where taker spent maker payment transactions were sometimes incorrectly marked as successful when they were actually reverted or not confirmed, particularly in EVM-based swaps. [#2199](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2199)
    - Two new events were added: "MakerPaymentSpendConfirmed" and "MakerPaymentSpendConfirmFailed"
  - A fix was introduced where Takers don't need to confirm their own payment as they can wait for the spending of it straight away. [#2249](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2249)
    - This invalidates this fix [#1442](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/issues/1442), a better solution will be introduced where taker rebroadcasts their transaction if it's not on the chain.
  - A fix was introduced for recover funds for takers when the swap was marked as unsuccessful due to the maker payment spend transaction not being confirmed. [#2242](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2242)
    - The required confirmations from coin config for taker/maker payment spend are now used instead of using 1 confirmation max. This is because some chains require more than 1 confirmation for finality, e.g. Polygon.
- Swap watchers [#1431](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/1431)
  - Taker fee validation retries now work the same way as for makers. [#2263](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2263)
- Electrum Client
  -  Electrum client was refactored to add min/max connection controls, with server priority based on list order. [#1966](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1966)
    - Electrum client can now operate in single-server mode (1,1) to reduce resource usage (especially beneficial for mobile) or multi-server (legacy) mode for reliability.
    - Higher priority servers automatically replace lower priority ones when reconnecting during periodic retries or when connection count drops below minimum.
- Coins Activation
  - EVM addresses are now displayed in full in iguana v2 activation response. [#2254](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2254)
- HD Wallet [#1838](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/issues/1838)
  - Balance is now returned as `CoinBalanceMap` for both UTXOs and QTUM. [#2259](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2259)
    - This is to return the same type/json across all coins for GUIs since EVM uses `CoinBalanceMap`.
  - EVM addresses are displayed in full in `get_new_address` response after [#2264](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2264)
- RPC Service
  - A fix was introduced to run rpc request futures till completion in [#1966](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1966)
    - This ensures RPC request futures complete fully even if clients disconnect, preventing partial state updates and maintaining data consistency.
- Security Enhancements
  - Message lifetime overflows were added to prevent creating messages for proxy with too long lifetimes. [#2233](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2233)
  - Remote files are now handled in a safer way in CI. [#2217](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2217)
- Build Process
  - `wasm-opt` overriding was removed. [#2200](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2200)
- Escaped response body in native RPC was removed. [#2219](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2219)
- Creation of the all-zeroes dir on KDF start was stopped. [#2218](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2218)
- OPTIONS requests to KDF server were added. [#2191](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2191)

**Removals:**

**NB - Backwards compatibility breaking changes:**
- `7777` Network deprecation and the upgrade to a new p2p layer breaks compatibility with previous versions of Komodo DeFi Framework. Connections between nodes/clients running an older version of Komodo DeFi Framework and nodes/clients running this latest version will not be possible. To avoid this, all nodes/clients must be upgraded to the latest version of Komodo DeFi Framework.
- Because of KMD burn of a part of the taker fee, the taker fee outputs for any `coin/KMD` swap are changed and makers running older versions will not be able to validate the taker fee, this will cause the swap to fail. This case will never happen anyway because older versions will not be able to connect to this latest version due to the network upgrade.
- Because of the removal of the fixed 0.0001 min threshold for TakerFee, taker fee validation will also fail for these cases. Again, this case will never happen as the previous case.
