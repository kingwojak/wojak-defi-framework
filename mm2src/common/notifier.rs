//! A simple notification system based on mpsc channels.
//!
//! Since this is based on mpsc, multiple notifiers (senders) are allowed while only a single
//! notifiee (receiver) listens for notifications.
//!
//! NOTE: This implementation memory leaks (in contrast to tokio's, but not used here to avoid tokio dependency on wasm).
//! This is because with each `clone()` of the sender we have a new slot in the channel (this is how `futures-rs` does mpsc).
//! These are removed when the receiver calls `wait()`, which calls `clear()`. But if the receiver never `wait()`s for any reason,
//! and there is a thread that doesn't stop `notify()`ing, the channel will keep growing unbounded.
//!
//! So one must make sure that either `wait()` is called after some time or the receiver is dropped when it's no longer needed.
